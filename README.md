# About This Homestead Knowledgebase
This document is a combination of applied and theoretical knowledge documented and gathered by a real homesteader. Hopefully this knowledge base can help new and existing homesteaders, but it is important to understand the philosophy of the author to know if this guide is right for you. 

This author believes it is essential to get a solid homestead up and running as quickly as possible and designed to have the maximum resiliancy against external risks and threats and to reduce dependency on external inputs whenever possible. In practice, that may look like spending your money on a tractor and several implements to get your land developed quickly while also getting livestock that need minimal to no feed to survive. 

If a homesteader is unable to easily or reliably purchase goods because of unjust laws or restrictions, a tractor without fuel is an expensive lawn ornament but a homesteader can continue to do what they were doing before, just more slowly. But if a homesteader owns animals that require high amounts of feed to survive, the homesteader must make tough decisions if they cannot buy feed for their animals. 

Permaculture is the underlying goal for all that exists in this guide. Permaculture means a lot of things to a lot of people, but for this author, it means creating a land and animal management system that has redundancy, maximizes mutually beneficial synergies, cares for the land and wildlife, and improves the land so it is better each year than it was the year before. It does not include rain barrels or other such things that are not useful/beneficial at scale. It is believed that an up-front initial investment of a lot of time and resources into the land will provide yields for decades and reduce ineffecient work.

# Homesteading Knowledge Base
The knowledge in this base is limited to the author(s) experience or knowledge on the subject. For example, the [Goat section](#Goats) currently only has information on Nigerian Dwarves. This is not because Nigerian Dwarves are the best goat and other goats are not worth discussing, rather it is because Nigerian Dwarves are the only goat the author has experience with.

## Pond Management
## Livestock Management
### Overview and Principles
- [Video - Gardening With Livestock | Tacota Coen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bbwuxybeb-4)
	- Design Rule #1 - If there is a yield of an element that cannot be put to productive use it results in drudgery and then pollution
	- Design Rule #2 - Any need of an element not met by the ecosystem results in pollution and then drudgery
		- Drudgery is punishment for stupidity
- [Video - Integrating Livestock into Your Resilient Home Acreage or Farm  | Tacota Coen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTUiPV6OZRw)
	- How do I integrate livestock into my context?
		- Understand your holistic context

		- Define your holistic goal
		- Understand each animal's zone of brilliance

## Electric Wire
### Training-on-Electric-Wire
## Multi-Species Grazing
### Cattle
### Goats
Goats are another ruminant that provide value in their ability to eat plants and weeds that cattle and sheep will not eat. Goats have about a 60% browse/40% grass diet, however, despite popular belief, goats are very picky eaters. If left to free-range, goats will travel around to all their favorite plants and eat them until they have destroyed them, then move to their next favorite plants and so on until they have turned the area into a desert. Proper management is essential and this is most easily accomplished with rotational paddock grazing. If a goat is limited to an area they will eat the weeds and woody material other animals will not, but do not forget they still want 40% of their diet to be grass overtime.

- Fencing
	- It is essential to properly [train](#Training-on-Electric-Wire) your goats on a very hot electric wire system the very first time they interact with electric wire. 
		- Polywire. Diffculty: **Hard** - Minimum 3 strands but a determined goat may still find her way out. If the herd is large enough, culling goats that escape may be the best option. *Do not rely on polywire for keeping a buck away from a pregnant doe*
		- Electric Netting. Difficulty: **Easy** - Goats are easily contained but this solution is much more expensive and labor-intensive than polywire.

- Feed Requirements
	- Summer: Rotational Graze
	- Winter: Supplemental Hay
	- Salt Lick Year-round
- Maintenance
	- Hoof trimming one to two times a month, depending on your land.

### Fruit Trees
- Vermont Wild Apples [PerfectCircleFarm](https://www.perfectcircle.farm/vermont-wild-apples/vermont-wild-apples)
	- About ~10 varities of wild apple trees. Descriptions in link. ~$40 per tree
- Crabapple [SilverRun](https://silverrunforestfarm.org/nursery/apple)
	- Our trees will grow well as landscaping, as pollinating support for other trees, and as excellent wildlife food. The wood can also be coppiced for fragrant firewood that burns slow and hot, to warm your house or smoke meats. We mostly harvest crabapples for cider mixes with other apples and pears, as well as some batches of straight crab for sours! The fruits are nutritious and loaded with pectin for spicy preserves and juice
- Regular Apples [HumbleAbode](https://humbleabodenursery.com/product/apples/)
- Peach [HumbleAbode](https://humbleabodenursery.com/product/peaches/) [NutsAndBolts](https://www.nutsandboltsnursery.com/shop/p/peach)
- Cherry [NutsandBolts](https://www.nutsandboltsnursery.com/shop/p/cherry)
	- Cherries like full sun and will benefit from companion planting with a nitrogen fixer and winecap-inoculated mulch.
- [Lots of good trees from hiddenspring](http://www.hiddenspringsnursery.com/plants.php)
### Large Trees
- Cornelian Cherry [SilverRun](https://silverrunforestfarm.org/nursery/corneliancherry)
	- Good for pig feed, Eastern Europe taste for human,  Zones 4-8
- Chinese Chestnut [SilverRun](https://silverrunforestfarm.org/nursery/chinese-chestnut-castanea)
	- Plant in orchard rows for abundant nuts, as a canopy in a forest garden, or as coppice trees for firewood, building material, and mushroom logs!
	- Hardy from Zone 5-8. 30-60 feet. Two trees are needed for pollination. Prefer dry to moist well-drained soils.
- Honey Locust[SilverRun](https://silverrunforestfarm.org/nursery/honeylocust)
		- Thornless varierty
		- Great for hogs, goats, sheep, and cows. 
- Persimmon [HumbleAbode](https://humbleabodenursery.com/product/american-persimmon)[Quiverwood](https://quiverwoodnursery.com/fruit-trees/persimmon) 
	- The persimmon trees we have for sale are seed grown. Unlike other fruit trees persimmons are relatively pest and disease free. This makes them ideal for a low maintenance garden. Persimmons are largely unknown to the general populace because when ripe they are too soft to ship to grocery stores without damaging them. This is unfortunate because they are incredibly delicious and almost everyone would enjoy the flavor and sweetness. Their drought tolerance makes them suitable for planting on dry sites. Persimmons are excellent wildlife trees because unharvested fruit stays on the tree into the winter. Planting more than one tree is necessary because persimmons can be either male or female and both are required for fruit set.
	- Climate zones:  5 - 9
	- Height:  40'
	- Width:  30'
